# unity_gamedevelopement_extremerace

I developed a 2-D racing game for in-house project in my 2nd year using unity and visual studio(editor) and named it extreme race( actually very similar to need for speed (initial version)).Since I shifted to linux operating system a year ago and deleted unity and all the editors , so in short i dont have my actually working project with me but i have my reports 
of both the games I developed and some of the codes. I learned it from youtube and various other websites since the link I  shared below works on the old version of unity. (The codes in my repostiory are latest version)


Hope you too enjoy this!!
