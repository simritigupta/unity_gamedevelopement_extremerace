# unity_gamedevelopement_extremerace

I developed a 2-D racing game in my 2nd year using unity and visual studio(editor) and named it extreme race( actually very similar to need for speed (initial version)).
Since I shifted to linux operating system a year ago and deleted unity and all the editors , so in short i dont have my actually working project with but i have my reports 
of both the games I developed. I learned it from youtube it was really amazing experience and i learned alot and actually fall in love with my game.
I have shared the link below where I learned it.
Hope you too enjoy this!!
